In all of our examples, there has been no doubt about whether the data were consistent with the model's predictions. The data were either very far away from the predictions, or very close to them.\n",

Using statistical tests as a way of making decisions is standard in many fields and has a standard terminology. Here is the sequence of the steps in most statistical tests, along with some terminology and examples. You will see that they are consistent with the sequence of steps we have used for assessing models."

    "All statistical tests attempt to choose between two views of the world. Specifically, the choice is between two views about how the data were generated. These two views are called *hypotheses*.\n",

    "The word \"null\" reinforces the idea that if the observed data look different from what the null hypothesis predicts, the difference is due to *nothing* but chance.\n",

    "From a practical perspective, **the null hypothesis is a chance model under which you can simulate data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example about Mendel's model for the colors of pea plants, the null hypothesis is that the assumptions of his model are good: each plant has a 75% chance of having purple flowers, independent of all other plants. \n",

    "Under this hypothesis, we were able to simulate random samples, by using `sample_proportions(sample_size, [0.75, 0.25])`. \n",

    "- So also if the answer is \"small values.\" \n",
    "- But if the answer is \"both big values and small values,\" we recommend that you look again at your statistic and see if taking an absolute value can change the answer to just \"big values\". That will simplify the comparison between the statistic and the predicitons made by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the pea plants, a sample percent of around 75% will be consistent with the model, but percents much bigger or much less than 75 will make you think that the model isn't good. This indicates that the statistic should be the *distance* between the sample percent and 75, that is, the absolute value of the difference between them. Big values of the distance will make you lean towards the alternative.\n",
    "\n",

    "The conventions are based on the area in the tail, starting at the observed statistic (the red dot) and looking in the direction that makes us lean toward the alternative (the left side, in this example). If the area of the tail is small, the observed statistic is far away from the values most commonly predicted by the null hypothesis.\n",

To find the area in the tail, we have to find the percent of sample averages that were less than or equal to the average score of Section 3, where the red dot is. The array `averages` contains the simulated averages for all 50,000 repetitions of the random sampling, and `observed_statistic` is 13.667, the average score of Section 3."

    "This is an approximation to the exact chance of getting a random sample average of 13.667 or lower, because we have computed it based on 50,000 samples, not all possible samples. But it's a good approximation because 50,000 is a lot of samples.\n",

    "- If the P-value is even smaller – less than 1% – the result is called \"highly statistically significant.\"\n",

So, following convention, we would have to conclude that the GSI's defense holds good – the average score of Section 3 is like those generated by random chance. Formally, the result of the test is not statistically significant. We can't reject the null hypothesis of random selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you make a conclusion based on a test of hypotheses, we recommend that you don't just say whether or not the result is statistically significant. You may even choose not to use the conventional cutoffs. Along with your conclusion, provide the observed statistic and the P-value as well, so that readers can use their own judgment."

    "### Historical Note on the Conventions ###\n",
    "\n",
    "The determination of statistical significance, as defined above, has become standard in statistical analyses in all fields of application. When a convention is so universally followed, it is interesting to examine how it arose. \n",
    "\n",
    "The method of statistical testing – choosing between hypotheses based on data in random samples – was developed by Sir Ronald Fisher in the early 20th century. Sir Ronald might have set the convention for statistical significance somewhat unwittingly, in the following statement in his 1925 book *Statistical Methods for Research Workers*. About the 5% level, he wrote, \"It is convenient to take this point as a limit in judging whether a deviation is to be considered significant or not.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "What was \"convenient\" for Sir Ronald became a cutoff that has acquired the status of a universal constant. No matter that Sir Ronald himself made the point that the value was his personal choice from among many: in an article in 1926, he wrote, \"If one in twenty does not seem high enough odds, we may, if we prefer it draw the line at one in fifty (the 2 percent point), or one in a hundred (the 1 percent point). Personally, the author prefers to set a low standard of significance at the 5 percent point ...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Fisher knew that \"low\" is a matter of judgment and has no unique definition. We suggest that you follow his excellent example. Provide your data, make your judgment, and explain why you made it."
