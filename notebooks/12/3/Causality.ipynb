    "Our methods for comparing two samples have a powerful use in the analysis of randomized controlled experiments. Since the treatment and control groups are assigned randomly in such experiements, differences in their outcomes can be compared to what would happen just due to chance if the treatment had no effect at all. If the observed differences are more marked than what we would predict as purely due to chance, we will have evidence of *causation*. Because of the unbiased assignment of individuals to the treatment and control groups, differences in the outcomes of the two groups can be ascribed to the treatment.\n",

    "### Treating Chronic Back Pain: A Randomized Controlled Trial ###\n",
    "Low-back pain in adults can be very persistent and hard to treat. Common methods run the gamut from corticosteroids to acupuncture. A [randomized controlled trial (RCT)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11376175) examined the effect of using Botulinum Toxin A as a treatment. Botulinum toxin is a neurotoxic protein that causes the disease botulism; [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botulinum_toxin) says that botulinum \"is the most acutely lethal toxin known.\" There are seven types of botulinum toxin. Botulinum Toxin A is one of the types that can cause disease in humans, but it is also used in medicine to treat various diseases involving the muscles. The RCT analyzed by Foster, Clapp, and Jabbari in 2001 examined it as a treatment for low back pain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirty one patients with low-back pain were randomized into treatment and control groups, with 15 in the treatment group and 16 in control. The control group was given normal saline, and the trials were run double-blind so that neither doctors nor patients knew which group they were in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eight weeks after the start of the study, nine of the 15 in the treatment group and two of the 16 in the control group had pain relief (according to a precise definition used by the researchers). These data are in the table `bta` and appear to show that the treatment has a clear benefit."

If the null hypothesis were true, it wouldn't matter which of those 31 outcomes were labeled \"treatment\" and which \"control.\" Any random subset of 16 out of the 31 values could be called \"control\" and the remaining 15 \"treatment\".\n",

But beware: without randomization, this association would not imply that the treatment caused a change in back pain outcomes.  For example, if the patients themselves had chosen whether to administer the treatment, perhaps the patients experiencing more pain would be more likely to choose the treatment *and* more likely to experience some reduction in pain even without medication.  Pre-existing pain would then be a *confounding factor* in the analysis."

    "### A Meta-Analysis ###\n",
    "\n",
    "While the RCT does provide evidence that the botulinum toxin A treatment helped patients, a study of 31 patients isn't enough to establish the effectiveness of a medical treatment. This is not just because of the small sample size.  Our results in this section are valid for the 31 patients in the study, but we are really interested in the population of *all possible patients*.  If the 31 patients were a random sample from *that* larger population, our confidence interval would be valid for that population.  But they were not a random sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2011, a group of researchers performed a [meta-analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21249702) of the studies on the treatment. That is, they identified all the available studies of such treatments for low-back pain and summarized the collated results. \n",
    "\n",
    "There were several studies but not many could be included in a scientifically sound manner: \"We excluded evidence from nineteen studies due to non-randomisation, incomplete or unpublished data.\" Only three randomized controlled trials remained, one of which is the one we have studied in this section. The meta-analysis gave it the highest assessment among all the studies (LBP stands for low-back pain): \"We identified three studies that investigated the merits of BoNT for LBP, but only one had a low risk of bias and evaluated patients with non-specific LBP (N = 31).\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Putting it all together, the meta-analysis concluded, \"There is low quality evidence that BoNT injections improved pain, function, or both better than saline injections and very low quality evidence that they were better than acupuncture or steroid injections. ...  Further research is very likely to have an important impact on the estimate of effect and our confidence in it. Future trials should standardize patient populations, treatment protocols and comparison groups, enlist more participants and include long-term outcomes, cost-benefit analysis and clinical relevance of findings.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes a lot of careful work to establish that a medical treatment has a beneficial effect. Knowing how to analyze randomized controlled trials is a crucial part of this work. Now that you know how to do that, you are well positioned to help medical and other professions establish cause-and-effect relations."
