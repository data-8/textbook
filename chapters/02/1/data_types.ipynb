    "# 1. Data Types\n",
    "In Python, data types define the kind of data a variable can hold. They determine the operations that can be performed on the data and how it is stored in memory. Data types help Python understand whether you're dealing with numbers, text, collections, or more complex structures like functions and objects. Understanding data types is essential because it helps you know how to manipulate and interact with the data in your programs.\n",
