# The Data 8 Jekyll textbook

This repository holds a Jekyll-based version of the Data 8 textbook.

All textbook content is primarily stored in Jupyter notebooks in the `content/` folder.
This can be converted to Jekyll-ready markdown and served on github pages.

## How this repository is deployed to `inferentialthinking.com`

The Data 8 textbook has a slightly more complex deploy process. This is because
[GitHub doesn't work well for using a custom domain name for an organization's non-root
repository](https://help.github.com/articles/custom-domain-redirects-for-github-pages-sites/).

So, here's how the textbook deploy works:

* The textbook at `inferentialthinking.com` is actually being served from this repository:

  https://github.com/inferentialthinking/inferentialthinking.github.io

  **You should not ever directly edit the inferentialthinking.github.io repository**
* Updates to the textbook should be made at **this** repository (`github.com/data-8/texbook`)
* When you make a change to this repository and push it to the `data-8/textbook` gh-pages
  branch, these changes should automatically be copied to https://github.com/inferentialthinking/inferentialthinking.github.io.
* This is done with CircleCI, and the [configuration for this can be found](.circleci/config.yml)

## Building the textbook
Here are steps to get started building the textbook on your own machine:

1. **Install the jupyter-book command line tool**. This allows you to create
   and modify Jupyter Books:

   ```
   pip install jupyter-book
   ```

2. **Follow the build instructions on the Jupyter Book guide**. The guide
   has information for how to use the Jupyter Book CLI to build this book.
   You can find the [Jupyter Book build instructions here](https://jupyterbook.org/start/build.html).

   A short summary (see the link for full details):
   If you have Ruby and bundle installed,
   install the dependencies by running
   `bundle install`, then running `gem pristine ...` for each warning.
   Once the dependencies are installed, run `make book` and then `make build`.

**To preview your built site** using Jekyll on your computer, follow
the steps on the [Jupyter Book guide](https://jupyter.org/jupyter-book/guide/03_build.html#build-the-books-site-html-locally-optional).
The short version is to run `make serve`, then visit `http://127.0.0.1:4000/chapters/intro` in your browser.
