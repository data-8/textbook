<h3 id="The-Variability-of-the-Sample-Mean">The Variability of the Sample Mean<a class="anchor-link" href="#The-Variability-of-the-Sample-Mean">Â¶</a></h3><p>By the Central Limit Theorem, the probability distribution of the mean of a large random sample is roughly normal. The bell curve is centered at the population mean. Some of the sample means are higher, and some lower, but the deviations from the population mean are roughly symmetric on either side, as we have seen repeatedly. Formally, probability theory shows that the sample mean is an <em>unbiased</em> estimate of the population mean.</p>
<p>In our simulations, we also noticed that the means of larger samples tend to be more tightly clustered around the population mean than means of smaller samples. In this section, we will quantify the variability of the sample mean and develop a relation between the variability and the sample size.</p></div></div>

<p>Now let's take random samples and look at the probability distribution of the sample mean. As usual, we will use simulation to get an empirical approximation to this distribution.</p>
<p>We will define a function <code>simulate_sample_mean</code> to do this, because we are going to vary the sample size later. The arguments are the name of the table, the label of the column containing the variable, the sample size, and the number of simulations.</p></div></div>

<p>You can see the Central Limit Theorem in action â the histograms of the sample means are roughly normal, even though the histogram of the delays themselves is far from normal.</p>
<p>You can also see that each of the three histograms of the sample means is centered very close to the population mean. In each case, the "average of sample means" is very close to 16.66 minutes, the population mean. Both values are provided in the printout above each histogram. As expected, the sample mean is an unbiased estimate of the population mean.</p></div></div>

<p>Take a look at the SDs in the sample mean histograms above. In all three of them, the SD of the population of delays is about 40 minutes, because all the samples were taken from the same population.</p>
<p>Now look at the SD of all 10,000 sample means, when the sample size is 100. That SD is about one-tenth of the population SD. When the sample size is 400, the SD of all the sample means is about one-twentieth of the population SD. When the sample size is 625, the SD of the sample means is about one-twentyfifth of the population SD.</p>

<p>The formula shows that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The population size doesn't affect the accuracy of the sample mean. The population size doesn't appear anywhere in the formula.</li>
<li>The population SD is a constant; it's the same for every sample drawn from the population. The sample size can be varied. Because the sample size appears in the denominator, the variability of the sample mean <em>decreases</em> as the sample size increases, and hence the accuracy increases.</li>

<h3 id="The-Square-Root-Law">The Square Root Law<a class="anchor-link" href="#The-Square-Root-Law">Â¶</a></h3><p>From the table of SD comparisons, you can see that the SD of the means of random samples of 25 flight delays is about 8 minutes. If you multiply the sample size by 4, you'll get samples of size 100. The SD of the means of all of those samples is about 4 minutes. That's smaller than 8 minutes, but it's not 4 times as small; it's only 2 times as small. That's because the sample size in the denominator has a square root over it. The sample size increased by a factor of 4, but the SD went down by a factor of $2 = \sqrt{4}$. In other words, the accuracy went up by a factor of $2 = \sqrt{4}$.</p>
<p>In general, when you multiply the sample size by a factor, the accuracy of the sample mean goes up by the square root of that factor.</p>
<p>So to increase accuracy by a factor of 10, you have to multiply sample size by a factor of 100. Accuracy doesn't come cheap!</p></div></div></div>
