<p>In the last chapter, we learned how to estimate an unknown numerical <em>parameter</em> such as a population mean or proportion. Our estimate was derived from a large random sample drawn from the population.</p>
<p>The method of estimation was based on a fundamental observation: While one sample provides a single estimate of the parameter, we know that the sample could have come out differently, and hence <em>the estimate could have been different</em>. The estimate varies, depending on the sample.</p>
<p>To quantify the amount of variability in the estimate, we need a measure of how different the estimate could be across all possible samples. That measure is the standard error of the estimate. If the estimate is a sample mean or sample proportion, mathematical theory provides us with a good approximation to the standard error, using just the one sample that we have.</p>
<p>But what if the estimate were a statistic other than a mean or a proportion?</p></div></div>

<p>Here is an example where this question arises. The table <code>baby</code> contains data on a random sample of 1,174 pairs of mothers and their newborn infants. Birth weight is an important factor in the health of a newborn infant – smaller babies tend to need more medical care in their first days than larger newborns. It is therefore helpful to have an estimate of birth weight before the baby is born. One way to do this is to examine the relationship between birth weight and the number of gestational days.</p>
<p>We will begin by constructing a measure of this relationship. For each baby, we will calculate the ratio of birth weight to the number of gestational days. Below, the original table <code>baby</code> has been augmented by the column <code>r_bwt_gd</code> containing the values of this ratio. The first entry in that column was calcualted as follows:</p>
$$
\frac{120~\mbox{ounces}}{284~\mbox{days}} ~\approx ~ 0.4225~ \mbox{ounces per day}

<p>To estimate the median of the ratios in the population, we have to figure out how different the median might have been in another sample. But there is no helpful mathematical formula that tells us how to estimate this variability based on our sample alone.</p>
<p>If we knew the distribution of the population, we could replicate the sampling procedure and generate the empirical distribution of the sample median. But we don't know the distribution of the population – we don't even know its median. That's what we are trying to estimate in the first place.</p>
<p>What we do have is a large random sample. As we know, a large random sample is likely to resemeble the population from which it is drawn. This observation allows data scientists to <em>lift themselves up by their own bootstraps</em>: the sampling procedure can be replicated by <em>sampling from the sample</em>.</p>
<h2 id="Resampling-from-the-Sample">Resampling from the Sample<a class="anchor-link" href="#Resampling-from-the-Sample">¶</a></h2><p>Here are the steps of <em>the bootstrap method</em> for generating an empirical histogram of the sample median.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Treat the sample as if it is the population.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Draw from the sample</strong>, at random <strong>with</strong> replacement, <strong>the same number as the sample size</strong>. Calculate the median.</li>
<li>Do this repeatedly. You will get as many medians as the number of repetitions.</li>
<li>Draw the histogram of all these medians. This is called a bootstrap empirical distribution of the sample median. It is an approximation to the probability distribution of the sample median.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to resample the same number of times as the original sample size. The reason is that the estimate is based on the original sample. In order to see how much the estimate could vary, we have to compare it to estimates computed from samples of the same size. For example, the median of about 0.429 ounces per day in our sample of 1,174 babies must be compared to the medians of other samples of size 1,174.</p></div></div>

<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<p>The code below uses the method <code>sample</code> to draw at random with replacement from all the ratios in the original sample. Notice that the sample size does not have to be specified.

Since <code>baby</code> has one row for each baby, the default sample size of <code>sample</code> is exactly the number required for the bootstrap method.</p></div></div>

<p>To generate a bootstrap empirical distribution of the sample medians, it is necessary to replicate the sampling procedure many times.

<li><p>We used the bootstrap in the previous section without giving the method a name. When we approximated the SE of the sample mean by replacing the population SD with the sample SD, we were letting the large random sample play the role of the population – that is the essence of the bootstrap method.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To approximate the probability distribution of a statistic, it is a good idea to replicate the resampling procedure as many times as possible. A few thousand replications will result in decent approximations to the distribution of sample median, especially if the distribution of the population has one peak and is not very asymmetric. We used 10,000 replications in the example above.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The bootstrap percentile method works well for estimating the population median based on a large random sample. However, it has limitations, as do all methods of estimation. For example, it is not expected to do well in of the following situations.</p>
<ul>
<li>The goal is to estimate the minimum or maximum value in the population, or a very low or very high percentile, or most parameters that are greatly influenced by rare elements of the population.</li>
<li>The probability distribution of the statistic is not roughly normal.</li>
<li>The original sample is small.</li>
