<li>Step 3 is display of the table, and the call to <code>hist</code> in the subsequent cell.</li>

<h3 id="Estimating-the-number-of-enemy-aircraft">Estimating the number of enemy aircraft<a class="anchor-link" href="#Estimating-the-number-of-enemy-aircraft">¶</a></h3><p>In World War II, data analysts working for the Allies were tasked with estimating the number of German warplanes. The data included the serial numbers of the German planes that had been observed by Allied forces. These serial numbers gave the data analysts a way to come up with an answer.</p>
<p>To create an estimate of the total number of warplanes, the data analysts had to make some assumptions about the serial numbers. Here are two such assumptions, greatly simplified to make our calculations easier.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>There are N planes, numbered $1, 2, ... , N$.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The observed planes are drawn uniformly at random with replacement from the $N$ planes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The goal is to estimate the number $N$. That's the unknown parameter.</p>
<p>Suppose you observe some planes and note down their serial numbers. How might you use the data to guess the value of $N$? A natural and straightforward statistic to use as an estimate would simply be the <strong>largest serial number observed</strong>.</p>
<p>Let us see how well this statistic works as an estimate. But first, another simplification: Some historians now estimate that the German aircraft industry produced almost 100,000 warplanes of many different kinds, But here we will imagine just one kind. That makes Assumption 1 above easier to justify.</p>
<p>Suppose there are in fact $N = 300$ planes of this kind, and that you observe 30 of them. We can construct a table called <code>serialno</code> that contains the serial numbers 1 through $N$. We can then sample 30 times with replacement (see Assumption 2) to get our sample of serial numbers. Our statistic is the maximum of these 30 numbers. That's what we will use as our estimate of the parameter $N$.</p></div></div>

<p>This is a histogram of the 750 estimates, each of which is an observed value of the statistic "largest serial number observed."</p>
<p>As you can see, the estimates are all crowded up near 300, even though in theory they could be much smaller. The histogram indicates that as an estimate of the total number of planes, the largest serial number might be too low by about 10 to 25. But it is extremely unlikely to be underestimate the true number of planes by more than about 50.</p></div></div>

Indeed, you will have a complete enumeration of all the possible values of the statistic and all their probabilities.</p>
<p>In other words, you will have the probability distribution of the statistic, and its probability histogram.</p>
<p>The probability distribution of a statistic is also called the <em>sampling distribution</em> of the statistic, because it is based on all of the possible samples.</p>
<p>But, as we have also noted above, the total number of possible samples is often very large. For example, the total number of possible sequences of 30 serial numbers that you could see if there were 300 aircraft is</p></div></div>

<p>That's a lot of samples. Fortunately, we don't have to generate all of them. We know that the empirical histogram of the statistic, based on many but not all of the possible samples, is a good approximation to the probability histogram. Thus the empirical distribution of a statistic gives a good idea of how different the statistic could be.</p>
<p>It is true that the probability distribution of a statistic contains more accurate information about the statistic than an empirical distribution does. 
But often, as in this example, the approximation provided by the empirical distribution is sufficient for data scientists to understand how much a statistic can vary. And empirical distributions are easier to compute, if you have a computer. Therefore, data scientists often use empirical distributions instead of exact probability distributions when they are trying to understand the properties of a statistic.</p></div></div>

<h3 id="A-Different-Estimate-of-the-Parameter">A Different Estimate of the Parameter<a class="anchor-link" href="#A-Different-Estimate-of-the-Parameter">¶</a></h3><p>Here is an example to illustrate this point. Thus far, we have used the largest observed serial number as an estimate of the total number of planes. But there are other possible estimates, and we will now consider one of them.</p>
<p>The idea underlying this estimate is that the <em>average</em> of the observed serial numbers is likely be about halfway between 1 and $N$. Thus, if $A$ is the average, then</p>
<p>$$
A ~ \approx ~ \frac{N}{2} ~~~ \mbox{and so} ~~~ N \approx 2A
$$</p>
<p>Thus a new statistic can be used to estimate the total number of planes: take the average of the observed serial numbers and double it.</p></div></div>
<div class="inner_cell">
<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<p>How does this method of estimation compare with using the largest number observed? It is not easy to calculate the probability distribution of the new statistic. But as before, we can simulate it to get the probabilities approximately. Let's take a look at the empirical distributions of both statistics based on repeated sampling. The number of repetitions is chosen to be 750, the same as it was in the earlier simulation, for ease of comparison.</p></div></div>

<p>You can see that the old method almost always underestimates; formally, we say that it is <em>biased</em>. But it has low variability, and is highly likely to be close to the true total number of planes.</p>
<p>The new method overestimates about as often as it underestimates, and thus is roughly <em>unbiased</em> on average in the long run. However, it is more variable than the old estimate, and thus is prone to larger absolute errors.</p>
<p>This is an instance of a <em>bias-variance tradeoff</em> that is not uncommon among competing estimates. Which estimate you decide to use will depend on the kinds of errors that matter the most to you. In the case of enemy warplanes, underestimating the total number might have grim consequences, in which case you might choose to use the more variable method that overestimates about half the time. On the other hand, if overestimation leads to high costs of needlessly guarding against planes that don't exist, you might be satisfied with the method that underestimates by a modest amount.</p></div></div>
