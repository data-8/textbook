<h2 id="Comparing-Two-Groups">Comparing Two Groups<a class="anchor-link" href="#Comparing-Two-Groups">¶</a></h2><p>In the examples above, we investigated whether a sample appears to be chosen randomly from an underlying population. We did this by comparing the distribution of the sample with the distribution of the population. A similar line of reasoning can be used to compare the distributions of two samples. In particular, we can investigate whether or not two samples appear to be drawn from the same underlying distribution.</p></div></div>

<h3 id="Example:-Married-Couples-and-Unmarried-Partners">Example: Married Couples and Unmarried Partners<a class="anchor-link" href="#Example:-Married-Couples-and-Unmarried-Partners">¶</a></h3><p>Our next example is based on a study conducted in 2010 under the auspices of the National Center for Family and Marriage Research.</p>
<p>In the United States, the proportion of couples who live together but are not married has been rising in recent decades. The study involved a national random sample of over 1,000 heterosexual couples who were either married or "cohabiting partners" – living together but unmarried. One of the goals of the study was to compare the attitudes and experiences of the married and unmarried couples.</p>
<p>The table below shows a subset of the data collected in the study. Each row corresponds to one person. The variables that we will examine in this section are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marital Status: married or unmarried</li>
<li>Employment Status: one of several categories described below</li>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Age: Age in years</li>

<p>The <code>married</code> column of this table shows the distribution of employment status of the married men in the sample. For example, among married men, the proportion who are retired is about 0.059. The <code>partner</code> column shows the distribution of the employment status of the unmarried men in the sample. Among unmarried men, the proportion who are retired is about 0.014.</p>
<p>The two distributions look different from each other in other ways too, as can be seen more clearly in the bar graphs below. It appears that a larger proportion of the married men in the sample work as paid employees, whereas a larger proportion of the unmarried men are not working but are looking for work.</p></div></div>

<p>We can answer the question by performing a statistical test of hypotheses. Let us use the terminology that we developed for this in the previous section.</p></div></div>
<div class="inner_cell">
<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<p><strong>Null hypothesis.</strong> In the United States, the distribution of employment status among married men is the same as among unmarried men who live with their partners.</p>
<p>Another way of saying this is that employment status and marital status are <em>independent</em> or <em>not associated</em>.</p>
<p>If the null hypothesis were true, then the difference that we have observed in the sample would be just due to chance.</p>
<p><strong>Alternative hypothesis.</strong> In the United States, the distributions of the employment status of the two groups of men are different. In other words, employment status and marital status are associated in some way.</p></div></div>

<h3 id="Random-Permutations">Random Permutations<a class="anchor-link" href="#Random-Permutations">¶</a></h3><p>In order to compare this observed value of the total variation distance with what is predicted by the null hypothesis, we need to know how the total variation distance would vary across all possible random samples if employment status and marital status were not related.</p>
<p>This is quite daunting to derive by mathematics, but let us see if we can get a good approximation by simulation.</p>
<p>With just one sample at hand, and no further knowledge of the distribution of employment status among men in the United States, how can we go about replicating the sampling procedure? The key is to note that <em>if</em> marital status and employment status were not connected in any way, then we could replicate the sampling process by replacing each man's employment status by a randomly picked employment status from among all the men, married and unmarried.</p>
<p>Doing this for all the men is equivalent to randomly rearranging the entire column containing employment status, while leaving the marital status column unchanged. Such a rearrangement is called a <em>random permutation</em>.</p></div></div>
<div class="inner_cell">
<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<p>Thus, under the null hypothesis, we can replicate the sampling process by assigning to each man an employment status chosen at random without replacement from the entries in the column <code>Employment Status</code>. We can do the replication by simply permuting the entire <code>Employment Status</code> column and leaving everything else unchanged.</p></div></div>

<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">

<p>A glance at the figure shows that the two distributions are different in the sample. The difference in the category "Not working – other" is particularly striking: about 22% of the married women are in this category, compared to only about 8% of the unmarried women. There are several reasons for this difference. For example, the percent of homemakers is greater among married women than among unmarried women, possibly because married women are more likely to be "stay-at-home" mothers of young children. The difference could also be generational: as we saw earlier, the married couples are older than the unmarried partners, and older women are less likely to be in the workforce than younger women.</p></div></div>

<p>While we can see that the distributions are different in the sample, we are not really interested in the sample for its own sake.

That is the population from which the sample was drawn.</p>
<p>We have to consider the possibility that the observed difference in the sample could simply be the result of chance variation. Remember that our data are only from a random sample of couples. We do not have data for all the couples in the United States.</p></div></div>

<h3 id="Deflategate:-Permutation-Tests-and-Quantitative-Variables">Deflategate: Permutation Tests and Quantitative Variables<a class="anchor-link" href="#Deflategate:-Permutation-Tests-and-Quantitative-Variables">¶</a></h3><p>On January 18, 2015, the Indianapolis Colts and the New England Patriots played the American Football Conference (AFC) championship game to determine which of those teams would play in the Super Bowl. After the game, there were allegations that the Patriots' footballs had not been inflated as much as the regulations required; they were softer. This could be an advantage, as softer balls might be easier to catch.</p>
<p>For several weeks, the world of American football was consumed by accusations, denials, theories, and suspicions: the press labeled the topic Deflategate, after the Watergate political scandal of the 1970's. The National Football League (NFL) commissioned an independent analysis. In this example, we will perform our own analysis of the data.</p>
<p>Pressure is often measured in pounds per square inch (psi). NFL rules stipulate that game balls must be inflated to have pressures in the range 12.5 psi and 13.5 psi. Each team plays with 12 balls. Teams have the responsibility of maintaining the pressure in their own footballs, but game officials inspect the balls. Before the start of the AFC game, all the Patriots' balls were at about 12.5 psi. Most of the Colts' balls were at about 13.0 psi. However, these pre-game data were not recorded.</p>
<p>During the second quarter, the Colts intercepted a Patriots ball. On the sidelines, they measured the pressure of the ball and determined that it was below the 12.5 psi threshold. Promptly, they informed officials.</p>
<p>At half-time, all the game balls were collected for inspection. Two officials, Clete Blakeman and Dyrol Prioleau, measured the pressure in each of the balls. Here are the data; pressure is measured in psi. The Patriots ball that had been intercepted by the Colts was not inspected at half-time. Nor were most of the Colts' balls – the officials simply ran out of time and had to relinquish the balls for the start of second half play.</p></div></div>

<p>At a glance, it seems apparent that the Patriots' footballs were at a lower pressure than the Colts' balls. Because some deflation is normal during the course of a game, the independent analysts decided to calculate the drop in pressure from the start of the game. Recall that the Patriots' balls had all started out at about 12.5 psi, and the Colts' balls at about 13.0 psi. Therefore the drop in pressure for the Patriots' balls was computed as 12.5 minus the pressure at half-time, and the drop in pressure for the Colts' balls was 13.0 minus the pressure at half-time.</p></div></div>

<p>It is apparent that the drop was larger, on average, for the Patriots' footballs. But could the difference be just due to chance?</p>
<p>To answer this, we must first examine how chance might enter the analysis. This is not a situation in which there is a random sample of data from a large population. It is also not clear how to create a justifiable abstract chance model, as the balls were all different, inflated by different people, and maintained under different conditions.</p>
<p>One way to introduce chances is to ask whether the drops in pressures of the 11 Patriots balls and the 4 Colts balls resemble a random permutation of the 15 drops. Then the 4 Colts drops would be a simple random sample of all 15 drops. This gives us a null hypothesis that we can test using random permutations.</p>

<p>The independent investiagtive team analyzed the data in several different ways, taking into account the laws of physics. The final report said,</p>
<p>"[T]he average pressure drop of the Patriots game balls exceeded the average pressure drop of the Colts balls by 0.45 to 1.02 psi, depending on various possible assumptions regarding the gauges used, and assuming an initial pressure of 12.5 psi for the Patriots balls and 13.0 for the Colts balls."</p>
<p>-- <em>Investigative report commissioned by the NFL regarding the AFC Championship game on January 18, 2015</em></p>
<p>Our analysis shows an average pressure drop of about 0.73 psi, which is consistent with the official analysis.</p>
<p>The all-important question in the football world was whether the excess drop of pressure in the Patriots' footballs was deliberate. To that question, the data have no answer.
