<p>Tables are a powerful way or organizing and visualizing data. However, large tables of numbers can be difficult to interpret, no matter how organized they are. Sometimes it is much easier to interpret graphs than numbers.</p>
<p>In this chapter we will develop some of the fundamental graphical methods of data analysis. Our source of data is the <a href="http://www.imdb.com">Internet Movie Database</a>, an online database that contains information about movies, television shows, video games, and so on. The site <a href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com">Box Office Mojo</a> provides many summaries of IMDB data, some of which we have adapted. We have also used data summaries from <a href="http://www.the-numbers.com">The Numbers</a>, a site with a tagline that says it is "where data and the movie business meet."</p></div></div>

<p>The table <code>actors</code> contains data on Hollywood actors, both male and female. The columns are:</p>
<table>

<td><code>Total Gross</code></td>

<td><code>Number of Movies</code></td>
<td>The number of movies the actor has been in</td>

<tr>

<p>In the calculation of the gross receipt, the data tabulators did not include movies where an actor had a cameo role or a speaking role that did not involve much screen time.</p>
<p>The table has 50 rows, corresponding to the 50 top grossing actors. The table is already sorted by <code>Total Gross</code>, so it is easy to see that Harrison Ford is the highest grossing actor. In total, his movies have brought in more money at domestic box office than the movies of any other actor.</p></div></div>

<p><strong>Terminology.</strong>
A <em>variable</em> is a formal name for what we have been calling a "feature", such as 'number of movies.' The term <em>variable</em> emphasizes that the feature can have different values for different individuals – the numbers of movies that actors have been in varies across all the actors.</p>
<p>Variables that have numerical values, such as 'number of movies' or 'average gross receipts per movie' are called <em>quantitative</em> or <em>numerical</em> variables.</p></div></div>
<div class="inner_cell">
<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<h3 id="Scatter-Plots">Scatter Plots<a class="anchor-link" href="#Scatter-Plots">¶</a></h3><p>A <em>scatter plot</em> displays the relation between two numerical variables. You saw an example of a scatter plot in an early section where we looked at the number of periods and number of characters in two classic novels.</p>
<p>The Table method <code>scatter</code> draws a scatter plot consisting of one point for each row of the table. Its first argument is the label of the column to be plotted on the horizontal axis, and its second argument is the label of the column on the vertical.</p></div></div>

<p>The plot contains 50 points, one point for each actor in the table. You can see that it slopes upwards, in general. The more movies an actor has been in, the more the total gross of all of those movies – in general.</p>
<p>Formally, we say that the plot shows an <em>association</em> between the variables, and that the association is <em>positive</em>: high values of one variable tend to be associated with high values of the other, and low values of one with low values of the other, in general.</p>
<p>Of course there is some variability. Some actors have high numbers of movies but middling total gross receipts. Others have middling numbers of movies but high receipts. That the association is positive is simply a statement about the broad general trend.</p>
<p>Later in the course we will study how to quantify association. For the moment, we will just think about it qualitatively.</p></div></div>

<p>This is a markedly different picture and shows a <em>negative</em> association. In general, the more movies an actor has been in, the <em>less</em> the average receipt per movie.</p>
<p>Also, one of the points is quite high and off to the left of the plot. It corresponds to one actor who has a low number of movies and high average per movie. This point is an <em>outlier</em>.

<p>The great actor Robert DeNiro has the highest number of movies and the lowest average receipt per movie. Other fine actors are at points that are not very far away, but DeNiro's is at the extreme end.</p>
<p>To understand the negative association, note that the more movies an actor is in, the more variable those movies might be, in terms of style, genre, and box office draw. For example, an actor might be in some high-grossing action movies or comedies (such as Meet the Fockers), and also in a large number of smaller films that may be excellent but don't draw large crowds. Thus the actor's value of average receipts per movie might be relatively low.</p>

<p>As an actor, Anthony Daniels might not have the stature of Robert DeNiro. But his 7 movies had an astonishingly high average receipt of nearly $452$ million dollars per movie.</p>
<p>What were these movies? You might know about the droid C-3PO in Star Wars:
<img alt="C-3PO" src="/images/C-3PO_droid.png"/>
That's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Daniels">Anthony Daniels</a> inside the metallic suit. He plays C-3PO.</p>
<p>Mr. Daniels' entire filmography (apart from cameos) consists of movies in the high-grossing Star Wars franchise. That explains both his high average receipt and his low number of movies.</p>
<p>Variables such as genre and production budget have an effect on the association between the number of movies and the average receipt per movie.

<p>The total domestic gross receipt was higher in 2009 than in 2008, even though there was a financial crisis and a much smaller number of movies were released.</p>
<p>One reason for this apparent contradiction is that people tend to go to the movies when there is a recession. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/movies/01films.html?_r=0">"In Downturn, Americans Flock to the Movies,"</a> said the New York Times in February 2009. The article quotes Martin Kaplan of the University of Southern California saying, "People want to forget their troubles, and they want to be with other people." When holidays and expensive treats are unaffordable, movies provide welcome entertainment and relief.</p>
<p>In 2009, another reason for high box office receipts was the movie Avatar and its 3D release. Not only was Avatar the #1 movie of 2009, it is also by some calculations the second highest grossing movie of all time, as we will see later.</p></div></div>
