# Data Types

Every value has a type, and the built-in `type` function returns the type of the result of any expression.



One type we have encountered already is a built-in function. Python indicates that the type is a `builtin_function_or_method`; the distinction between a *function* and a *method* is not important at this stage.



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
type(abs)

```
</div>

<div class="output_wrapper" markdown="1">
<div class="output_subarea" markdown="1">


{:.output_data_text}
```
builtin_function_or_method
```


</div>
</div>
</div>



This chapter will explore many useful types of data.
