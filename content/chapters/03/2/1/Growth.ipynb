    "# Example: Growth Rates\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between two measurements of the same quantity taken at different times is often expressed as a *growth rate*. For example, the United States federal government [employed](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2013/article/industry-employment-and-output-projections-to-2022.htm) 2,766,000 people in 2002 and 2,814,000 people in 2012. To compute a growth rate, we must first decide which value to treat as the `initial` amount. For values over time, the earlier value is a natural choice. Then, we divide the difference between the `changed` and `initial` amount by the `initial` amount."
