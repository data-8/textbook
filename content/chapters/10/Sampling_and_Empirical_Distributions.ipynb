If you stand at a street corner and take as your sample the first ten people who pass by, you might think you're sampling at random because you didn't choose who walked by. But it's not a random sample – it's a *sample of convenience*. You didn't know ahead of time the probability of each person entering the sample; perhaps you hadn't even specified exactly who was in the population."
