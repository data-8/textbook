    "In the previous chapters we developed skills needed to make insightful descriptions of data. Data scientists also have to be able to understand randomness. For example, they have to be able to assign individuals to treatment and control groups at random, and then try to say whether any observed differences in the outcomes of the two groups are simply due to the random assignment or genuinely due to the treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we begin our analysis of randomness. To start off, we will use Python to make choices at random. In `numpy` there is a sub-module called `random` that contains many functions that involve random selection. One of these functions is called `choice`. It picks one item at random from an array, and it is equally likely to pick any of the items. The function call is `np.random.choice(array_name)`, where `array_name` is the name of the array from which to make the choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the following code evaluates to `treatment` with chance 50%, and `control` with chance 50%."
